# BOOK-REVIEW
Develop a book review platform where users can browse books, read and write reviews, and rate books. The application should have a React frontend and a Node.js backend using Express and SQL/MongoDB.
Create a responsive UI with the following pages/components:
Home page with featured books
Book listing page with search and filter functionality
Individual book page with details and reviews
User profile page
Review submission form
Implement state management (e.g., using Redux or React Context)
Use React Router for navigation
Integrate with the backend API
Implement error handling and loading states

Set up a RESTful API with the following endpoints:
GET /books - Retrieve all books (with pagination)
GET /books/:id - Retrieve a specific book
POST /books - Add a new book (admin only)
GET /reviews - Retrieve reviews for a book
POST /reviews - Submit a new review
GET /users/:id - Retrieve user profile
PUT /users/:id - Update user profile
Implement data validation and error handling
Use SQL/MongoDB for data persistence
